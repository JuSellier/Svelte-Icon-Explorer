## Issues & Potential Limitations

- BUILD TIMES ARE SLOW AF ðŸ’© (due to grouped icon imports, there's probably better ways to handle that...)
- Performance & Optimization for rendering many icons (maybe use intersection observer || button to "load more icons"...)
- Game Icons: GiJetPack is causing parsing errors
- Many icons lead to an error: `Error: <path> attribute d: Expected moveto path command ('M' or 'm'), "undefined".`
